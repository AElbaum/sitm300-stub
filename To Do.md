   ~~ Fix bug where serial number isnt read by client on startup~~
       ~~ Fixed, but need to start the client first~~
        ~~Make simulator check for client~~


Part 2: Software Application
~~1. Have a GUI that user can use to interact with the software.~~
2. Give the user to start the hardware simulator through the GUI, with an option to provide any
initial data required by the simulator.
3. Give user a choice to run various tests. These are – “Test serial command”, “Test normal mode”,
“Test auto mode”. User must be able to provide a sequence and select the tests they want to
